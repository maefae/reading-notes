# 401 Reading Notes - Implementation: Trees

One way I can remember the terminology for trees is by comparing them to human anatomy. There's the head of the person that is connected by bones (branches) and joints (nodes).
The node contains two properties, a value and next in order to move onto the next node of the tree. The person's height is the number of edges from head to the furthest philange.

For blood to travel throughout the body, there are tree methods of traversal: 

Pre-order: root >> left >> right
In-order: left >> root >> right
Post-order: left >> right >> root

# Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
```markdown
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

# Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, strikethrough, subscript, or superscript text in comment fields and .md files.

# Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. 
To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.

# Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word or phrase. To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, 
add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.

# Bold and Italic
To emphasize text with bold and italics at the same time, add three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. 
To bold and italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, add three asterisks without spaces around the letters.

# Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

# Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. 
You can also press the Command+E (Mac) or Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.
```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.
```markdown
Some basic Git commands are:
---
git status
git add
git commit
---
```

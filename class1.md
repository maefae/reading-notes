# What is markdown?
Markdown is a light weight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax

# Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.
```markdown
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
```

# paragraphs
are creted by separating lines of text by using a blank line in betweeen 

# Line breaks
are created by using two white spaces after the last word or letter. Then you can just continue typing on the line underneath 

# Styling text
You can italicize, bold, etc. in your .md files 

# Bold
To bold text, add two asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase. 
To bold the middle of a word for emphasis, add two asterisks without spaces around the letters.
for example: ** bold **
__ bold __

# Bold and Italic
Type three asteriks before and after
for example: *** ***

# Italic
To italicize text, add one asterisk or underscore before and after a word(s). To italicize the middle of a word for emphasis, 
add one asterisk without spaces around the letters.
for example: * italicize * or 
_ italicize _ or 
italize the * middle of this sentence

# Quoting text
quote text with a >.


# Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. 
Ctrl+E (Windows/Linux) keyboard shortcut will create the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.
```markdown
Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
```

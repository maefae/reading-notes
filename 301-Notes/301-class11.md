five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
- SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.

- SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. This means that SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.

- SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.

- SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.

- SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware. NoSQL databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
 	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
 complex query intensive environment

Give a real world example.
 complex query intensive environment


What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
 - hierarchical data storage following key-value pairs, large data sets

Give a real world example.
- MongoDB

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
- NoSQL


Which type of database is best for scalability?
- NoSQL because they are horizontally scalable. Just add more servers.

What does SQL stand for?
- Structured Query Language

What is a relational database?
- works with certain assumptions and tables

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
- Tables

What is a ‘schema’?
- What the data is going to look like. How is it organized. what are the data types, "all students have a student id" a schema would reinforce that organization

What is a NoSQL database?
- A schema-less non-relational database

How does it work?
- no schema, no relations, relational data needs to be merged manually

What is inside of a Mongo database?
- less relation merging, super fast queries,

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
they both have different pros and cons

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
you can't rely on your data to have a certain field, if you have a lot of write requests that write in multiple collections

# 401 Class 12 - Socket.io

Reading
[Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?
An advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

A client sends a WebSocket handshake request, the server then returns a WebSocket handshake response. Once the connection is established communication switches to a bidirectional binary protocol.

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

4. What does the event handler io.on() do?
The on method is an event handler that handles connection and disconnection

6. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected
An example code block:
```js
const app = require('express')();
const http = require('http').Server(app);
app.get('/', function (req, res) { res.sendFile('E:/test/index.html');
});
//Whenever someone connects this gets executed
io.on('connection', function (socket) { console.log('A user connected');
//Whenever someone disconnects this piece of code executed
socket.on('disconnect', function () {
console.log('A user disconnected');
});
});
http.listen(3000, function () {
console.log('listening on *:3000');
});
```
call nodemon app.js in the terminal, and you should be able to render the index.html document in the browser. Upon visiting the root route, you should see in the console that "A user connected" When you leave the browser, you should see "A user disconnected"

7. What does socket.emit() do?
It is the method to broadcast an event to all the clients

8. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

- A websocket is communication between the Client and the Server over a TCP connection;

- Socket.Io is a library that allows event driven communication between clients and Web Servers.

9. When would you use Socket.IO?

- to broadcast to multiple sockets at a time.
- to automatically upgrade the requirements to WebSocket if needed
- IO works on work-based events.

10. When would you use WebSockets?

- When you need real time communication between a client and destination.

- When you don't require persistent connections between two systems

- when communication is one-to-one

13. What are your learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README?

My goal is to become more familiar with the concepts covered in these notes.

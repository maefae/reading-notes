## What is javascript?
**a light weight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions
- functionality of the page
- interactive
- if HTML is content, JS is what you do (interactive)

## Why do we use it?

## How do we use JS?
- script file < style > </style >
- app.js

in the script tag, you can use console.log(insertvariable); to print out the typed ansswer in the console section of your webpage. You can access your console
on windows by pressing: ctrl + shift + I simultaneously
example: 
let favoriteShow = prompt("What was your favorite tv series in 2022?");
        console.log(favoriteShow);

[Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4)
- What is a ‘call’?
invoking a function. The call stack deals with how the order functions are executed and they are done one at a time (from top to bottom) since it is synchronous.

- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
Calls happen one at a time, from top to bottom.

- What does LIFO mean?

```markdown
    function firstFunction(){ throw new Error('Stack Trace Error'); }

    function secondFunction(){ firstFunction(); }

    function thirdFunction(){ secondFunction(); }

    thirdFunction();
````

- What causes a Stack Overflow?
A function calling upon itself (recursive function) causes a stack overflow because it does not have an end point. 
The browser has a maximum stack call limit that it can reach before it produces a stack error.

# Data Structures and Algorithms - Why is this topic important?
This topic is important, because data structures create efficient algorithms and in combination, functioning resuable code.

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
The scalability of the data. So, how much space you need. 

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
Since a recursion function calls itself, it's easy to result in an infinite loop. That's why every recursive function has two parts: base case is when it does not call itself, recursion is when it does call itself. Use the base case to end the function.

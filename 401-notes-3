# Prep: THe Growth Mindset
## Summarize and explain this topic via an analogy from your previous work or home experience.

In order to teach yourself, you must push yourself just outside of your comfort zone. You need to have a growth mindset in order to follow through with this. 
After watching Carol Dweck's ted talk, it was interesting to see how there were literal brain differences in people with fixed mindsets and growth mindsets. 
A mindest should be "yet" not "now". Some things we can do is to praise wisely. (their effort, strategies, perseverences and improvement).

Angela Lee Duckworth's ted talk discusssed the topic of how essential grit is when it comes to pursuing your goals. It consists of perseverance and passion. 
You have to treat your life like it's a marathon rather than a sprint. Grit is not related to one's talents. The growth mindset increases grit. (ability to learn is not
fixed. It can change with effort).

Alain De Botton talks about Redefining success. A meritocratic society is one that believes talent, energy, and skill will help you get to the top. Which is not perfect 
because it makes it seem as though failure is more crushing. However, we need to have a mindset where anyone has the capability of becoming successful through the growth
mindset

When I first took the emotional intelligence quiz, I needed to improbe in the self-management department. I scored high on everything else. 
After re-taking the quiz, I noticed I had improved in the relationship section, because even though I found myself enduring so many obstacles in class 301, I persevered 
until graduation. I'm hoping that I can maintain the same level (if not more) grit in 401 starting on Monday. 

When I first took the bias quiz, I needed to improve my effectiveness to showing courage but acting on it as well. I had a tendency to crave pleasure and fun so I would 
prioritize hanging out with friends over the weekend instead of further studying. As a result, I felt like the majority of my cohort knew more than me. I also
have a tendency to want to avoid conflict, but as of lately, I've been pushing myself to have conversations that need to be said (even if it's difficult to do). I've 
also been re-thinking about what I should be prioritizing in my life, and have pulled away from hanging out with friends as much unless I know they are going to 
bring me up rather than pull me down.

# 401 Class 37 - Readings: Redux - Combined Reducers

Readings: Redux - Asynchronous Actions

[async actions](https://redux.js.org/advanced/asyncactions)

1. Why use Redux middleware?
Redux Middleware allows you to intercept every action sent to the reducer so you can make changes to the action or cancel the action. Middleware helps you with logging, error reporting, and making asynchronous requests

2. Consider the Redux Async Data Flow Diagram. Describe the flow in your own words.
- The user sets off the click event deposit
- The event handler dispatchâ€™s the action
- The middleware catches the action and makes an Api call.
- Then the dispatch is run through the store and uses the respective reducer to update the state.
- The state is updated to show the deposit in the UI.

3. How are we accommodating async in our Redux app?
Thunk middleware is being used to handle async logic in our redux app

[thunk middleware](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

1. Why would you need redux-thunk middleware?
Redux-thunk middleware is needed to handle async logic and side effects in a Redux app, such as making API calls.

2. Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a ____ instead of an action.
Redux Thunk middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.

3. Describe how any return value from the inner thunk function will be made available.
Any return value will be available as the return value of dispatch itself.

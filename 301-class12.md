# Readings: CRUD

[Status Codes Based On REST Methods](https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/)

- In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

100’s = Informational codes for the client, for example, sending a message to confirm a request was just received
200’s = Success codes that confirm a request was accepted.
300’s = Redirection codes that tell a client that their requested resource is unavailable at the requested information.
400’s = Client error codes. The various ways an error occurred during client request that leaves the request invalid. Always an error on the client end and not from the recieving server.
500’s = Server error codes. They indicate that some kind of error happened on the server end, such as an overwhelmed server not being able to process a request.

- What is a status code 202?
Asynchronous processing of a request. Doesn not mean the request was process, just that it met validation requirements at time of sending.

- What is a status code 308?
This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore.

- What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

- What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

- What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

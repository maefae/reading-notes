201 Reading Notes: class 14 - [CSS Transforms](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

This topic is important, because this skill will be able to allow the web developer to make dynamic webpages that look more professional.

- What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. 
Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 
Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. These three-dimensional 
transforms help define not only the length and width of an element, but also the depth. Weâ€™ll start by discussing 
how to transform elements on a two-dimensional plane, and then work our way into three-dimensional transforms.

- Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
```markdown
<figure class="box-1">Box 1</figure>
<figure class="box-2">Box 2</figure>
     
.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
```
I could see it being used on a website tring to convey rolling dice

[CSS Transitions & Animations](CSS Transitions & Animations)

- What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.
The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

- How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
animation uses the @keyframes and animates objects to move across a screen whereas transitions just have something transition from one thing to another.

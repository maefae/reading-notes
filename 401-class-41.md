# 401 Class 41 - Reading: React Native

[getting started with react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started)

1. Name three Core Components of React Native and describe what they do.
View - equivalent to non-scrolling <div>
Text - equivalent to <p>
Image - equivalent to <img>

2. What problem does React Native solve (why call it native)?
React Native allows us to build mobile applications using React to interact with Android and iOS to create apps using Android and iOS native elements.

3. What are the building blocks of a React Native app? How does that compare to a React app?
The building blocks for a React Native app are React Components and Reactive Native Components, which contain Community, Core and our own Native Components. This compares to a plain React app in that we take these components as building blocks to create our UI.

[expo](https://expo.io/)

1. What solution does expo provide?
Expo provides us with a the solution to use React Native and JavaScript to create mobile apps more simply compared to using just React Native.

2. Expo tries to manage as much of the complexity of building apps as possible, which is why we call it the ____ workflow.
"managed"

3. What is the difference between React Native and Expo?
The difference is that Expo gives us the ability to develop apps solely using JavaScript, while React Native without Expo has us work using the bare workflow, meaning that we are responsible for the native iOs and Android projects.

[expo snack](https://snack.expo.io/)

1. Checkout this tool. What does snack allow you to do?
Expo Snack allows us to write code in the online editor and use it instantly on a phone.

[ejecting]()

1. What does “eject” mean within the context of Expo?
Eject in the context of Expo refers to the concept of allowing us to take our pure-JS project and create native projects for both iOS and Android that can be opened with XCode and Android Studio.
  
2. When should you not eject?
We should not eject if we just need to distribute our app in the iTunes Store and Google Play. We also should not eject if we are not comfortable with native code.
  
3. Why might you choose to eject?
We might choose to eject when our Expo project needs a native module that Expo doesn't support.

Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
  **Syntax errors**: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” 
  you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools 
  and know what the error messages mean!
  
  **Logic errors**: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives
  incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
I had a javascript syntax error where a function would not work and after what felt like hours of trying to figure it out, I realized it was because I had capitalized 
the name of the function but had the invocation of the function lower-cased. 

Another error I came across was a logic error where the questions on my guessing game repeated entirely twice. I realized it was literally because I had accidentally 
wrote the line of code twice

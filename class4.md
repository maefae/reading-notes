  # What is HTML? hyper text markup language
  
  The **opening tag:** This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect in this case where the paragraph begins.
  
  The **closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
  
  The **content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
  
  The **element:** The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

  - Provides basic artifact to be tested with users to confirm/deny different design choices
  - important to keep things SIMPLE

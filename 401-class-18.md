# 401 Class 18 - AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

[AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

1. What is Amazon API Gateway?
Amazon API Gateway is a service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the "front door" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services.

2. Why is Amazon API Gateway an important part of the Serverless ecosystem?
Within the Serverless ecosystem, API Gateway is the piece that ties together Serverless functions and API definitions. Being able to trigger the execution of a Serverless function directly in response to an HTTP request is the key reason why API Gateway is so valuable in Serverless setups: it enables a truly serverless architecture for web applications. When using API Gateway together with other AWS services, it’s possible to build a fully functional customer-facing web application without maintaining a single server yourself. This brings the advantages of the serverless model—scalability, low maintenance, and low cost due to low overhead—to mainstream web applications.

3. How does API Gateway integrate with other AWS services?
it supports direct integrations

1. What are the some benefits of using Amazon API Gateway?
its integration and usability alongside of or to improve other Amazon Web Services.

2. What two API types might you choose from?
RESTful APIs or WEBSOCKET APIs

[AWS DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/what-is-dynamo-db/)

1. What is DynamoDB?
A hosted NoSQL database service from Amazon Web Services.

2. Under what circumstances would you recommend DynamoDB over MongoDB?
When using other AWSs that would already integrate and work well with your database.

[AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)

1. Explain to a non-technical friend how DynamoDB works.
DynamoDB stores a key(name) and value(definition of word/name/key). A value describes/is connected to the key, the key describes/is connected to the value

[Dynamoose](https://dynamoosejs.com/getting_started/Introduction)

1. What is Dynamoose?
Dynamoose is is an object document modeling (ODM) tool for AWS DynamoDB inspired by Mongoose, an ODM for MongoDB.

2. What are some key features of Dynamoose?
Type safety

High level API

Easy to use syntax

DynamoDB Single Table Design Support

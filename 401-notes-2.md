# Prep: Practice in the Terminal

## The Command Line
I learned that a GUI is a system of interactive visual components for computer software, and that the command line is also known as bash, or the terminal.  

## Basic Navigation - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it.
PWD (print working directory) shows where you are in the terminal. ls (short for list), shows a list of what is in our current location. 
Root directory is at the top of the structure. Absolute paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to the root directory.
Relative paths specify a location (file or directory) in relation to where we currently are in the system.

## More About Files - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment.
Everything is a file, including your monitor, keyboard, etc. That was really interesting to me. It's also interesting how linux is an extensionless system where you
have to type in file[path] in order to know the extent of what the file in your terminal is.

## Manual Pages - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.
A set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.
You can do a keyword search on the Manual pages. It's man -k <search term>.

## File Manipulation - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories.
Creating a directory is pretty easy. The command we are after is mkdir which is short for Make Directory.

mkdir [options] <Directory>

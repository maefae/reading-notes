# 401 class 35 - Implementation: Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that contains nodes and edges

A node (vertex) contains a single unique value, whereas an edge is the connection between two nodes.

For example, on Instagram, each user represents a node. When you follow a user, you are connecting from one user to another (creating a new edge, connecting the two nodes together). In this case, the connection is a **directed** graph, which means the edge only goes one way: (1) --> (2), because one user (node) follows the other account, and doesn't automatically result in the other user following them back. 

However, if it is a friend request (like on FaceBook), then it is an **undirected graph** (edge connects both ways: (1) <--> (2), because the friend request must be accepted in order for both nodes to become linked together.

**weighted** graphs indicate that the edges have additional data, like the distance between two airports on a map.

**cycle** graphs mean that the edge connects with itself like a round-trip bus that will eventually stop where it began.

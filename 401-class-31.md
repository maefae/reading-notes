[Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. What can React Context provide your app?
React Context provides a way to pass data through a component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. Cleaner code.

2. Why might we use Context?
We might use Context to share data that con be considered "global" for a tree of React compoents, such as the theme, authenticated user, or preferred language

3. Why should we use it sparingly?
It makes component reuse more difficult, because context is mainly used when data needs to be accesssed by many components at different nesting levels.

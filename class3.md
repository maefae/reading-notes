# Class 3 Reading Notes
dvcs stand for: distributed version control system
## What is Git?
- it's a version control system (dvcs)
- it let's multiple developers work on the same code
- a history of changes to your files
- the ability to view, apply, and remove those changes
- it makes collaboration possible!

Commit: each successive version creates a new snapshot on the timeline of the project. **git** keeps track of what the file looked like in different points of time
Each **commit** (snapshot) has a label that points to it
- HEAD = "you are here" (most recent version)
- You can also assign messages to commit (what did you do here that makes it different)
- messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot

# What is Github?
- github can be either public or private. github is not git
- public place to share and store code
- Github uses git to manage your team's work
- it uses version tracking, reviews changes, keep separate changes until you want to add them

# Git + GitHub = Awesomeness
With GIt (version control) and GitHub (online code storage), you can: 
- have lots of team members work together on the same files, without messing each other up
- keep a history of each file over time
- work on code on your computer, and sync it with what's online
**git is like the sport you play, whereas Github is like the arena or stadium in which you play**

# Repositories
A **repository** is a collection of files that you've told Git to pay attention to

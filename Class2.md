# Class 2 Reading Notes 

I use windows so I will be focusing on the CMD cheatsheet.Â 

For mac: terminal command

for Linux: Linux commands

Filepath indicates where you are in the system
**dir** is a command that displays a list of folder files and subfolders
**cd** (chdir) displays the name of the current directory or changes the current folder

**md** (mkdir) creates a folder (directory)
**rm** (rmdir) deletes a folder (directory)

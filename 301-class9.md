- What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
A pure function is a function that has the following properties:
It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred to as deterministic).
It does not cause any observable side effects.

- What are the benefits of a pure function?
The code is easier to test, to read and comprehend, and easier to debug.

- What is immutability?
code cannot be changed

- What is Referential transparency?
Referential transparency is when a function consistently yields the same result for the same input.

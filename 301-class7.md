What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding? He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?


Because they weren’t designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn’t have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?


HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns. The nouns are things like people, places, and things. The verbs are things like get, post, put, and delete. The nouns are the resources and the verbs are the actions that we want to perform on those resources.

What does a GET do?

GET is used to retrieve information from a server using a URL. It is the most common HTTP verb.


What does a POST do?

 It sends/submits/adds something to another server via http.

What does PUT do?




What does PATCH do?

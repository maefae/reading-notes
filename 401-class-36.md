# 401 Class 36 - Application State with Redux

[Dan Abramov Redux Tutorials](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)

1. What is the first principle of Redux?
The first principle of Redux is the "Single Source of Truth" principle. This principle states that the state of the whole application should be stored in a single, immutable store, rather than being spread out across multiple components or services. This store can only be modified through a set of predefined actions and reducers, which ensures that the state is always predictable and easy to debug.

2. what is a store and what do we use our reducers for within that store?
In Redux, a store is an object that holds the state of the entire application. It is created by passing a reducer function to the createStore() method. The store provides methods for accessing, updating, and subscribing to changes in the state. Reducers are used to update the state in the store. A reducer is a pure function that takes the current state and an action as input and returns a new state. Reducers are responsible for maintaining the integrity of the data and ensure that the state is updated in a predictable and consistent manner. Reducers are the only way to change the state in a Redux store.

3. Name three Redux store methods given to us by createStore and describe their use.
getState(): This method is used to retrieve the current state of the store. It returns the current state of the application, which can be used to render the UI or perform other logic.

dispatch(action): This method is used to dispatch an action to the store. An action is an object that describes a change to the state. When an action is dispatched, it is passed to the reducer function, which updates the state accordingly.

subscribe(listener): This method is used to subscribe to changes in the state. It takes a listener function as an argument, which is called whenever the state is updated. This is useful for updating the UI or performing other logic whenever the state changes.

4. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what combineReducers() does and why it is useful.
combineReducers() is a utility function provided by the Redux library that allows you to combine multiple smaller reducer functions into a single, larger reducer function.

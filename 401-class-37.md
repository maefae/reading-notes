# 401 class 37: Redux - Combined Reducers

Reading
[Multiple Reducers Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBER4Or86hE)

1. Why create multiple reducers?
With each reducer being responsible for managing a specific piece of the state, multiple reducers makes it easier test the code 
and make changes without affecting other parts of the codebase.

2. How would you combine multiple reducers?
By using combineReducers() to bring in all the reducers and set our defaults values and set actions/dispatching. This function takes an object whose values are 
different reducing functions and turns it into a single reducing function that can be passed to the createStore function.

3. How will you manage state as an immutable object? why?
State in a Redux application should be managed as an immutable object to ensure that the state is not accidentally modified by any of the reducers. 
This is important to maintain the integrity of the state and to ensure that the application behaves correctly.

Redux Docs: Using Combined Reducers

1. combineReducers is a utility function to simplify the most common use case when writing ___ _____ .
reducers

2. Explain how combineReducers assembles the new state tree.
CombineReducers takes an object whose values are different reducing functions and turns it into a single reducing function that can be passed 
to the createStore function, when the store's dispatch function is called, the action is passed to each of the individual reducers, 
which each update their respective parts of the state and the new state is then assembled into a single object.

3. How would you define initial state in an app using combineReducers?
Pass an object to combineReducers where the keys of the object correspond to the keys of the state and the values correspond to the initial state for each key.

Redux Docs: Combined Reducer Syntax

1. Why will you want to split your reducing functions as your app becomes more complex?
2. The _____(combineReducers) helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to ____(createStore).
3. What is a popular convention when naming reducers?
use the name of the state slice that the reducer is responsible for managing, with a "reducer" suffix, for example, categoriesReducer.

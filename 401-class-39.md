# 401 Class - Readings: Redux - Additional Topics

[Redux Toolkit (RTK)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

1. What concerns are addressed by Redux Toolkit?
It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

"Configuring a Redux store is too complicated"
"I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful"
"Redux requires too much boilerplate code"

2. What does configureStore() do?
configureStore(): wraps createStore to provide simplified configuration options and good defaults. It can automatically combine your slice reducers, adds whatever Redux middleware you supply, includes redux-thunk by default, and enables use of the Redux DevTools Extension.

3. How would I use createSlice()?
createSlice(): accepts an object of reducer functions, a slice name, and an initial state value, and automatically generates a slice reducer with corresponding action creators and action types.

[MobX](https://mobx.js.org/getting-started.html)

1. What is Mobx?
MobX is a battle-tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming.

2. How does MobX make it “impossible” to produce an inconsistent state?
MobX uses a strict set of rules for handling state updates, which makes it "impossible" to produce an inconsistent state. It uses a mechanism called "transactions" to ensure that all state updates are atomic and consistent, which makes it difficult to accidentally create an inconsistent state. This is different from Redux which uses a more explicit approach to manage state updates through actions and reducers.

3. How would we build a reactive user interface?
A reactive user interface can be built with MobX by using its decorators and observer component. Decorators are used to mark data as "observable", and observer component is used to automatically update the component when the data changes. This creates a seamless, reactive experience for the user, unlike Redux which requires more manual setup to connect components to the store.

What take-away(s) did this tutorial provide?
The tutorial gave me a broader understanding on how to get started quickly on redux. It also provided a tutorial on using redux in a real-world scenario as well as a guide that talks about how redux works. Furthermore, theree is a live-streamed tutorial that covers the fundamentals of setting up and utilizing Redux. The last four tutorials are specifically on using Redux Toolkit, including migrating existing applications to use with TypeScript.

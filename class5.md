What is CSS?
(Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages! CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

**document** is typically a text that's structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.

**Presenting** a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector, or printer.

# 401 Reading Notes - Ethics

Create a new page in your reading-notes repo with your reflections.

Review at least one article from both “Ethics in the workplace” and “Ethics in Technology” sections below and write how each of them relates to ethics in technology. Do you agree or disagree with these articles? What stuck out to you specifically from each article?

For this assignment, I read the article, "The Code I'm Still Ashamed of" by Bill Sourour, and "Morality, ethics of a self-driving car: Who Decides Who Lives, Died?" 
by Todd Spangler.

After reading each article, it still remains unclear as to what would be the "ethical thing to do" regarding technology. What it all boils down to, I think, is that the
individual who is working for these companies has to internally seek what is right vs. wrong. For example, in the article where Sourour talks about how he was ashamed for
being part of a company who designed a quiz for teenager girls that tricked them into buying a drug that would later result in the suicide of a client, unfortunately it comes
down to the employee. Is this something you will morally follow? Lots of grey areas for sure.

# 401 Class 1 - Node Ecosystem

1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

Node.js is an app that allows a Javascript program to run without having to use a web browser.

2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

This refers to where the Javascript code, its variables, etc. are stored and executed when run.

3. What is Node used for?

Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser. Node can, therefore, be used to write server-side applications with access to the operating system, file system, and everything else required to build fully-functional applications.
